#  Steel Ball Slalom – Design and Fabrication Project

This project was completed for a mechanical design course at the University of South Florida. The goal was to design, 3D model, fabricate, and assemble a functional device that could transport a steel ball through a compact, mechanical path — the "Steel Ball Slalom."

---

##  Project Summary

Our team developed a fully 3D-printed modular mechanism that allows one steel ball to be stored inside the system while a second ball follows a guided path to the output. The project involved four major design and fabrication milestones.

---

## Key Features

- Compact footprint: fits within 4" x 4" area
- No screws required — uses printed pins and snap fits
- Fully parametric design created in Fusion 360
- Functional mechanical interaction using angled lever
- 3D printed with PLA filament

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Fusion 360** (CAD design & assembly)
- **3D Printing** (PLA material)
- Manual assembly testing
- Iterative prototyping and redesigns

## Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Final Design_.f3z` | Fusion 360 project archive file (for full parametric design and timeline) |
| `Final Design.stl` | Printable STL model of final design |
| `Steel_Ball_Slalom_Report.pdf` | Final report with design sketches, fabrication steps, and results |

##  Milestones

1. **Milestone 1:** Sketching, brainstorming, and layout decisions
2. **Milestone 2:** Initial Fusion model and first prints (tested for fit and feasibility)
3. **Milestone 3:** Cost analysis, design refinement, print iteration
4. **Milestone 4:** Final model adjustments, reprinting, and full assembly testing

##  Lessons Learned

- Rapid prototyping is essential to refine mechanical functionality
- Collaboration and scheduled task division helped meet tight deadlines
- CAD flexibility (using parameters and timeline edits) sped up redesigns when parts failed
- Snap-fit connections reduced the need for fasteners and simplified assembly
